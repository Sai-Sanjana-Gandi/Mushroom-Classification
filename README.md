Mushroom-Classification
This project utilizes machine learning to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used is the Agaricus Lepiota Mushroom dataset, which includes various attributes such as cap shape, odor, gill color, stalk features, and more.

How to Run the Mushroom Classification Project

There are two ways to run the code for this project:


1. Run in Your Local IDE or Google Colab

You can copy and paste the code into your local Python IDE (such as IDLE, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code) or into a Google Colab notebook.
Once the code is pasted, run the script and provide the necessary mushroom traits (such as cap shape, color, odor, etc.) when prompted.
After the code is executed, the output will display the prediction (either Edible or Poisonous) based on the provided characteristics.

2. Access the Code Directly on GitHub
Alternatively, you can access the code directly through this GitHub repository.
Simply navigate to the mushroom_classification.py file in this repository and view the code without having to copy-paste it.
